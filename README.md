## Project Introduction
Nowadays, medicine and nutrition supplements are becoming an irreplaceable part of our lives. It is crucial for us to consume the designated dose at the designated time. For example, some medications are best if taken before the meal, while some are best if taken after, and some should be taken before going to bed. However, unknowns may happen, and people could miss the scheduled time to take the pills. Elder people might miss their medication due to amnesia. Adults may lose their track of medication by daily work. Many companies have developed apps or devices that could track usersâ€™ daily intake. But those types of devices usually cost a lot of money. Users also need to purchase multiple devices if taking various medications. So is it possible for us to design a more affordable and accessible solution? 

The objective of this project is to build a system using the small and cheap Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense that can detect different contexts in which the user fails to take the medical pills and set up context-based alarms to inform the user. We want to separate the board and the bottle to maintain the maximum usability of the bottle. Additionally, we will develop an app that gives the alarm and allows the user to interact with the system. Moreover, the context the user fails to take the medication we are dealing with in this project is whether the user is busy doing other things or he just totally forgot to take; the context of when to take the medication is that the user should take the pills after the meal. In the future, more contexts will be analyzed and researched to reach the full context-based characteristics of the alarm system.
