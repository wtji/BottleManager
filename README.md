## Project Introduction
Nowadays, medicine and nutrition supplements are becoming an irreplaceable part of our lives. It is crucial for us to consume the designated dose at the designated time. For example, some medications are best if taken before the meal, while some are best if taken after, and some should be taken before going to bed. However, unknowns may happen, and people could miss the scheduled time to take the pills. Elder people might miss their medication due to amnesia. Adults may lose their track of medication by daily work. Many companies have developed apps or devices that could track usersâ€™ daily intake. But those types of devices usually cost a lot of money. Users also need to purchase multiple devices if taking various medications. So is it possible for us to design a more affordable and accessible solution? 

The objective of this project is to build a system using the small and cheap Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense that can detect different contexts in which the user fails to take the medical pills and set up context-based alarms to inform the user. We want to minimally modify the pill bottle to maintain the maximum usability of the bottle. Additionally, we will develop an app that gives the alarm and allows the user to interact with the system. Moreover, the context the user fails to take the medication we are dealing with in this project is whether the user is busy doing other things or he just totally forgot to take; the context of when to take the medication is that the user should take the pills after the meal. In the future, more contexts will be analyzed and researched to reach the full context-based characteristics of the alarm system. Lastly, we want our monitor system and app to be interactable. This is achieved by the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection, which will be discussed later.

In conclusion, the three deliverable of our project should be
* Maximum compatibility
* Minimum cost
* Interactability

## Analysis of Literature
### Bluetooth LE Connection
Since our system consists of the Arduino part and the smartphone application part, the method of connection between them has become a crucial point of our project. In this project, we are using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense in our embedded system, so it is certain that we are going to use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection to send and receive data. The most significant difference between conventional bluetooth and BLE is that BLE does not require one-to-one connection. In addition, BLE introduces much less power supply than bluetooth, which is good for long term monitoring using only a button cell battery. Take a look at the following figure that describes the role of devices in BLE connection.

The BLE connection is like a bulletin board, where the peripheral device provides services and characteristics and the central devices act as clients of services (which is counter-intuitive in some sense). In our case, the Arduino board is the peripheral device which monitors the status of the medicine bottle and sends out service with a UUID that contains the status; the device installed with the monitor app is the central device which accesses the service using its UUID and reads the characteristics from or writes the characteristics to the Arduino board. 

The Arduino BLE library is very powerful and integrated with the classes and methods for the service part. For use BLE in Arduino, we just need to include the library
```
#include<ArduinoBLE.h>
```
To start a BLE connection, we have the following code
```
if (!BLE.begin()){
    Serial.println("starting BLE failed!");
    while (1);
}
```
To detect whether the central device is connected, we have to first create a central device object and then do the detection
```
// create a central device object
BLEDevice central = BLE.central();

if (central) {
    while (central.connected()) {
	// put the main activity here
    }
}
```
To send or receive data, the relevant service and characteristic object should be created using ```BLE.addService```, ```service.addCharacteristic()```, and the system should start advertising these characteristics using ```BLE.advertise()```. After the central is connected, the system can use ```characteristic.writeValue()``` and boolean check ```characteristic.written()``` to send or receive data. 

Things are a little bit complicated at the central device side. We take the application based on iOS as an example. In the Xcode (IDE for iOS development) ```info.plist``` file, we have add new privacies ```NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription, NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription``` to get the permission of using BLE connection. To use the BLE functions in Xcode, we have to ```import CoreBluetooth```. The BLE functions are realized in iOS by ```CBCentralManager``` and ```CBPeripheral```, so we have enable the viewcontroller with these two classes by adding extensions
```
extension ViewControllwer: CBCentralManagerDelegate, CBPeripheralDelegate {
    // put main activity here
}
```
After initializing the manager and peripherals, there are mainly six steps to complete the BLE connection and manipulation.
1. Check the current status of manager
2. Check if the central manager has discovered a peripheral
3. Check if the peripheral has been connected to the central manager
4. Check if there exists a service in the peripheral matched by the given service UUID
5. Check if there exists a characteristic in the service matched by the given characteristic UUID
6. If step 5 is verified, do the read and write operation on the characteristic


### Prior Related Projects
We have searched for other kinds of smart bottle projects. Two of them is worth mentioning. The first one is from https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/taifur/arduino-powered-water-bottle-42ee43. It is a smart bottle that can keep track of your water intake and reminds you to drink enough water. The detection of water consumption is achieved using a waterproof ultrasonic sensor which can detect the water level inside the bottle. The program will then convert the water level into liters of water consumed and display it on the LCD segment display, then notify the user if there is not enough water consumption through a buzzer. We regard it as a passive device which has no interactions between the user and the system. In our design, we want the system to actively interact with the user for better experience. Besides, the design requires modification to the cap of the bottle to fit the arduino board, ultrasonic sensor and the LCD display which is the opposite to our goal that requires minimum modification to the original bottle. Also, the usability of the system is limited as the system is only suitable to track liquid instead of other kinds of substances. 

The second one is from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7945434. It is a conference paper, so we are unable to find the source code for this project. Like the first one, this is also a water consumption tracker. The detection of water consumption is achieved using smartwatch gesture detection, and the system displays the water consumption on an app device. Compared to the first project, this one has significantly more compatibility since it detects the water consumption using an external device, but the cost of such an external device is usually high. One common problem of these two projects is that it uses regular Bluetooth, so the energy consumption is high, and it cannot last long without constant power supply (for the second project it seems not a big problem). Also, the regular Bluetooth limits the number of devices connected. Nevertheless, it is a nice and interesting project, and its system architecture is very similar to ours.
